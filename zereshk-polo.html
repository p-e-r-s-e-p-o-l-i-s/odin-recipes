    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The popular Zereshk Polo features many of the elements of Persian cooking.
      Barberries, which are quite tart and bright in color, are layered within
      the fluffy Basmati rice and served with succulent chicken, or if you
      prefer with lamb or beef . Zereshk Polo is a delightful dance of sweet and
      sour; one of the pillars of Persian cooking. Whether you like it sweet or
      more on the tart side, this dish has something to offer to everyone. The
      regal barberries are brought to life in the company of butter and sugar,
      while glistening with a luscious layer of saffron.

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3>Chicken</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large frying pan, saute the onions over medium heat for 10 minutes
        until translucent. Add turmeric and pepper and continue to saute for 2
        additional minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Remove the onions from the pan and set aside.</li>
      <li>
        In the same pan, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil and saute the
        chicken on medium high heat for 5 minutes on each side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the onions and add water to the chicken. Cover and cook over low
        heat for 60 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the tomato paste and salt and mix well. Cover and cook on low heat
        for 30 minutes or until the chicken is fork tender.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Rice</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wash the rice thoroughly and set aside to soak for at least one hour.
        Rinse.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large covered pot, bring 8 cups water and salt to a boil. Add the
        rinsed rice and boil on high heat uncovered for about 6-8 minutes, or
        until the rice has slightly softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the rice in a colander and set aside while you prepare the pan.
      </li>
      <li>Add 2 tablespoons of oil to a non-stick pot.</li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, mix 1 cup of the lightly cooked rice with 1 tablespoon
        of saffron-water mixture, gently mix and spread evenly in the bottom of
        the pot. This will be the crispy rice referred to as Tah-dig.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the remainder of the rinsed rice to the pot and lightly fluff with
        a fork.
      </li>
      <li>
        Evenly drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over the top of the
        rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the remaining 1/4 cup of water over the rice. Wrap the lid with a
        clean towel and place on top of the pot. This will allow the rice to
        steam.
      </li>
      <li>Allow the rice to steam over medium-low heat for 45 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Pour the remaining 1 tablespoon saffron water over the top of the rice.
        Turn off the heat and allow to sit for 5 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Barberries</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a small sauce pan, gently melt the butter and add the rinsed
        barberries, sugar and saffron water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir over low heat until the sugar has dissolved and barberries have
        come to life and brightened.
      </li>
      <li>
        This step is done over low heat and no more than 2-4 minutes. Take care
        to not burn the berries.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assembly</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select a large serving platter to place on top of the pan and carefully
        and swiftly invert the rice onto the platter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Decorate the barberries around the edges and on top of the rice and
        garnish with pistachios or almonds.
      </li>
      <li>Arrange the chicken pieces around the rice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
